A friend pointed me to the article about [Bitter Lessons][bitterlesson] learned
from 70 years AI research.  I found this a very interesting article making clear
what AI or machine learning is able to do.

The bitterness comes from the point of view that doing *search and learning* at
scale is like "brute force".  All approaches to build a system which tried to
implement the human knowledge reached a plateau relatively fast.  The automated
learning could be scaled and could beat the expert systems.

I was not disappointed about this at all.  In contrast -- it made clear to me
what the capabilities and limitations of AI are.  A computer given all the data
can approximate the equation to calculate the energy from the mass but it will
never come up with the beauty of the formula e = m c<sup>2</sup>.
